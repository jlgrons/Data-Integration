# Example code for meta-analysis simulation


* ci_sim_051118.R: Main file to run the simulation. 

* meta_fun_052818.R: Helper functions.

* k=10.sh: Script to run on cluster. 


Step 1: First run it on your laptop with the parameters in the ci_sim_051118.R file. 
Step 2: Run once on cluster.
Step 3: Run 100 iterations - send 5 jobs each with 20 iterations - time it and make sure file formatting is ok.
